When I read the chall, you know there is a username Riikaa_Chan.\
That means there is a social media account, so lets lookup into that username in twitter\
[https://twitter.com/Riikaa_Chan](https://twitter.com/Riikaa_Chan)\
\
Bingo! and we got the account.

When we go back to chall, there is a clue `just created an account`, so this account joined twitter in December 2021.\
So now, we looking for suspicious post, but unfortunately there is no suspicious post until first post.\
Maybe, there is deleted post in this account.\
\
You can go to `Wayback Machine` to looking up for deleted post *if there is any deleted post*,
and maybe we can get a new clue.
