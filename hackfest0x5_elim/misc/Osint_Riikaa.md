When I read the chall, you know there is a username Riikaa_Chan.\
That means there is a social media account, so lets lookup into that username in twitter\
[https://twitter.com/Riikaa_Chan](https://twitter.com/Riikaa_Chan)\
\
Bingo! and we got the account.

When we go back to chall, there is a clue `just created an account`, so this account joined twitter in December 2021.\
So now, we looking for suspicious post, but unfortunately there is no suspicious post until first post.\
Maybe, there is deleted post in this account.\
\
You can go to `Wayback Machine` to looking up for deleted post *if there is any deleted post*,
and maybe we can get a new clue.

\
If we compare with Rika's timeline, there is currently a post that seems to have been deleted by her, in that post there is a link, let's open it\

\
It turns out that the link leads to a pinterest post, if we look at the picture of the post, there is a people icon in the lower left corner which is the tagged people icon on Instagram. let's try to open the pinterest account to find another clue\

\
It turns out that there is a post that linked to Instagram where this link leads to the original photographer (probably)\

\
Our next task is to look for a post that is the same as the image Rika chan posted, in the comments section there will be a flag\

\
And the flag is `hackfest0x5{U_C4N_F1ND_M3_TH1S_i5_yOUr_fL@6}`
