\
In the bio of Rika Chan's Twitter account, there is a new clue which mean if you find the username Riikaa_Chan or RiikaaChan it's probably her. I use the sherlock username finder tool to make it easier to search with the username I'm looking for, RiikaaChan.\

\
There are many usernames but in this case I'll try go to the github profile\

\
There is a suspicious repository and this account has just been created too, we can check the github repository and also we can check the commit changes that have been made or if there is a merged pull request that occurs\

\
There are many commit changes that occurred, I searched for the commit changes one by one until I found the flag\
